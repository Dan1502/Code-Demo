# DWP-Value-Streams
Code that processes Value Streams data in DWP and then creates data visualisations. All data included has random numbers and is not reflective of the actual processes in DWP. 


# Motivation
The Value Streams Analysis was previously run on Excel, which was a very slow and manual process. Hence, my team worked on automating the analysis. Part of the data processing was done on Python, and further processing and production of data visualisations was done on RStudio. 

# Contents
1. Data: All data files needed for running this code is in the "Data" folder. In the DWP environment, the model could be run directly after the Python model was run. Here, you'd need to download these data files first instead and store them in a folder on your environment according to how the documentation mentions it to be.
2. Documentation: You will find all the necessary steps for running this model from start to finish here.
3. VS_Base_Graphs: This is the first part of the code in the model and should be run first.
4. VS_Activity_Analysis: This is a second, optional, part of the code that produces further analysis.
