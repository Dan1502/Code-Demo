# DWP-Value-Streams
Code that processes Value Streams data in DWP and then creates data visualisations. 


# Motivation
The Value Streams Analysis was previously run on Excel, which was a very slow and manual process. Hence, my team worked on automating the analysis. Part of the data processing was done on Python, and further processing and production of data visualisations was done on RStudio. 

# Contents
1. VS_Base_Graphs: This is the first part of the code in the model and should be run first.
2. VS_Activity_Analysis: This is a second, optional, part of the code that produces further analysis.
