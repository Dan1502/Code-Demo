# Code Demo
Here you will find 3 different code files, with two of them being in the R language and one in SQL / SAS. I wrote all of this code during my placement year in the Department for Work and Pensions.

# Contents
There are three separate code files stored here:
1. VS_Base_Graphs
2. VS_Activity_Analysis
3. Benefit Combinations SQL

# Motivations Behind Each Code File
VS_Base_Graphs and VS_Activity_Analysis were part of the same project that analysed DWP's operational spend. This code was used to move the analysis from Excel to RStudio and made the data visualisation process at least 75% more efficient in terms of time needed to complete the analysis. Furthermore, they also allowed further and more in-depth analysis which was not possible in Excel. 

The Benefit Combinations SQL code opened up analysis into a new benefit that was previously not included in the general benefit combinations analysis.
