# Data Loading & Processing


1. Loads the activity tables and creates an activity table for each benefit (e.g. AA_Acts)

``` {r}
for (ben in ben_list){
  # Creates an empty dataframe [benefit]_Acts that will be populated later
  assign(str_c(ben, "_Acts"), data.frame())
  # Runs a for loop to load all the activity tables into the RStudio environment
  for (prod in ben_prod_list[[ben]]){
    # Replaces the dash in prod name (if exists) as variables shouldn't include dashes in their name
    name <- gsub("-", "", prod)
    # Replaces the space in prod names with an underline for easier variable name assignment
    name <- gsub(" ", "_", name)
    # Saves the latest year as a variable
    year = tail(years, 1)
    # Tries loading the acts from the latest year
    tryCatch(
      # Reads the activity tables
      assign(name, read.csv(str_c(filepath, "/", year, "/Activity_Tables/Acts_", prod, "_", year, ".csv"), 
                            stringsAsFactors = FALSE)),
      # Highlights which activity tables could not be loaded
      error = function(e){
        print(e)
        cat(paste(prod, "failed to load\n\n"))
      },
      warning = function(w){
        print(w)
        cat(paste(prod, "failed to load\n\n"))
      }
    )
    # Removes the table we loaded if Total Costs = 0 and number of rows = 1 as this table is not valid
    if (get(name)$Total[1] == 0 & nrow(get(name) == 1)){
      remove(list = name)
      cat(str_c(prod, "'s activity table was removed.\n\n"))
      }
    # Otherwise, combines the activity table loaded to the [benefit]_Acts table created earlier
    else {
      assign(str_c(ben, "_Acts"), rbind(get(str_c(ben, "_Acts")), get(name)))
      }
  }
}
```


2. Combines all the activities into one data frame

``` {r}
# Create a dataframe to store all the activities
combined_acts <- data.frame()

for (ben in ben_list){
  # Create a new column in each of [ben]_Acts to specify which benefit the acts come from when combining
  # Also removes X, the row number column
  assign(str_c(ben, "_Acts"),
  get(str_c(ben, "_Acts")) %>%
    mutate(Benefit = ben)
  )
  
  # Combine the acts with the combined_acts dataframe
  combined_acts <- rbind(combined_acts, get(str_c(ben, "_Acts")))
}

# replaces "Processing" with "Benefit Handling*"
# UPDATE / REMOVE if the category "Processing" changes
combined_acts <- combined_acts %>%
  mutate(Category = replace(Category, Category == "Processing", "Benefit Handling*"))
```



3. Creating processed activity tables for each benefit  

``` {r}
# Creates a function that sums the cost for each activity for each benefit (disregards the product)
# This function also removes corporate, digital and estates costs

sum_act_costs <- function(ben){
  # Creates a table that sums costs over every activity & category combination
  act_table <- combined_acts %>%
    # filters the benefit you want
    # Also filters out corporate, digital, estates costs
    filter(Benefit == ben, 
           Category %in% customer_vs_list) %>% #update to recategorise Processing to benefit handling
    # Sums the staff, non-staff, and total costs for each activitiy regardless of product
    group_by(Activity, Category) %>%
    summarise(Staff_Costs = sum(Staff_Costs),
    Non_Staff_Costs = sum(Non_Staff_Costs), 
    Total = sum(Total)) %>%
    ungroup()
  
  # Creates a table, dupe_acts, of duplicate acts in act_table
  # Duplicate acts arise from acts having different costs for BCA, RA, Improve Employability.
  dupe_acts <- act_table %>%
    group_by(Activity) %>%
    mutate(Count = n()) %>%
    filter(Count > 1) %>%
    ungroup()
  
  # Edits the dupe_acts table to sum costs for these activities and rename their category to "Benefit Handling*"
  dupe_acts <- dupe_acts %>%
    group_by(Activity) %>%
    summarise(Category = "Benefit Handling*", 
              Staff_Costs = sum(Staff_Costs),
              Non_Staff_Costs = sum(Non_Staff_Costs),
              Total = sum(Total)) %>%
    ungroup()
  
  # Filters out the duplicate acts from the main act_table
  act_table <- act_table %>%
    filter(!(Activity %in% dupe_acts$Activity)) %>%
    # Adds in the summed up duplicate acts back into the act_table
    rbind(dupe_acts)
  
  # Returns act_table
  return(act_table)
}
```



``` {r}
# Runs a for loop to sum costs by activity for each benefit
# Overwrites the [benefit]_Acts table to store this
for (ben in ben_list){
  assign(str_c(ben, "_Acts_Processed"), 
         sum_act_costs(ben))
}
```







# Data Visualisations

1. Finding the n most costly activities for each benefit  



``` {r}
# Function that identifies the [n] most expensive activities for [ben]

  # Only retains Activity, Category and Total columns then adds Percent_Of_Total and Benefit columns

    mutate(Percent_Of_Total = Total/sum(get(str_c(ben, "_Acts_Processed"))$Total) * 100,
           Benefit = ben)
